Payload Collections are defined through configs of their own, and you can define as many as your application needs. Each Collection will map one-to-one with a MongoDB collection automatically based on fields that you define.

It's often best practice to write your Collections in separate files and then import them into the main Payload config.

## Collection Config Options

| Option           | Description  |
| ---------------- | -------------|
| `slug`           | Unique, URL-friendly string that will act as a global identifier for this collection. |
| `labels`         | Singular and plural labels for use in identifying this collection throughout Payload. |
| `fields`         | Array of field types that will determine the structure and functionality of the data stored within this collection. |
| `admin`          | Admin-specific configuration. See below for [more detail](/docs/collections#admin). |
| `preview`        | Function to generate preview URLS within the Admin panel that can point to your app. [More](/docs/collections#preview). |
| `hooks`          |

#### Simple example

```js
const Order = {
	slug: 'orders',
	labels: {
		singular: 'Order',
		plural: 'Orders',
	},
	fields: [
		{
			name: 'total',
			type: 'number',
			required: true,
		},
		{
			name: 'placedBy',
			type: 'relationship',
			relationTo: 'customers',
			required: true,
		}
	]
}
```
