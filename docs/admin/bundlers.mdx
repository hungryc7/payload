desc: Bundlers are used to bundle the code that serves Payload's Admin Panel.

Payload has two official bundlers, the [Webpack Bundler](/docs/admin/webpack) and the [Vite Bundler](/docs/admin/vite). You must install a bundler to use the Admin Panel.

##### Install a bundler

```ts
// To install the Webpack bundler
yarn add @payloadcms/webpack-bundler

// or to install the Vite bundler
yarn add @payloadcms/vite-bundler
```

##### Configure the bundler

```ts
// payload.config.ts

import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { webpackBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-webpack'
// import { viteBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-vite'

export default buildConfig({
  // highlight-start
  admin: {
    bundler: webpackBundler() // or viteBundler()
  },
  // highlight-end
})
```

### What are Bundlers?

At their core, a bundler's main goal is to take a bunch of files and turn them into a single file that you ship to the browser. The Admin Panel has a root entry point, from there the bundler traverses the dependency tree and bundles all of the files that are required to run the Admin Panel.

Since the bundled file is sent to the browser it cannot include any server-only code. You will need to remove any server-only code from your Admin Panel codebase before bundling it. You can learn more about [excluding server code](/docs/admin/excluding-server-code) section.

  <strong>Sercure Bundles</strong>
  <br />
  Bundles should not contain sensitive information. By default, Payload
  excludes env variables from the bundle. If you need to use env variables in your payload config,
  you need to prefix them with `PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_` to make them available to the client-side code.
