- Max failed login attempts
- Rate limiting - talk about config, and about how if behind proxy, need `app.set('trust proxy', true)`, otherwise all traffic is treated as 127.0.0.1
- GraphQL Complexity
- Limits - ?? this might not be a thing but it should be if it's not. We should limit the max number of records returned per page via config setting.
- Max Depth - recursive relationships, could create infinite loops with no max depth. this should be as small as possible without interrupting dev experience
- CSRF - link to config section with a quick blurb about how CSRF prevention is good for security
- CORS - link to config section with a quick blurb about how CORS restrictions are good for security
