  The Code field type saves a string in the database, but provides the Admin panel with a code editor styled interface.
</Banner>

This field uses `prismjs` for syntax highlighting and `react-simple-code-editor` for the editor itself.

### Config

| Option           | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| **`name`** *         | To be used as the property name when stored and retrieved from the database.  |
| **`label`**          | Used as a heading in the Admin panel and to name the generated GraphQL type. |
| **`unique`**         | Enforce that each entry in the Collection has a unique value for this field. |
| **`minLength`**      | Used by the default validation function to ensure values are of a minimum character length. |
| **`maxLength`**      | Used by the default validation function to ensure values are of a maximum character length. |
| **`validate`**       | Provide a custom validation function that will be executed on both the Admin panel and the backend. [More](/docs/fields/overview#validation) |
| **`saveToJWT`**      | If this field is top-level and nested in a config supporting [Authentication](/docs/authentication/config), include its data in the user JWT. |
| **`hooks`**          | Provide field-based hooks to control logic for this field. [More](/docs/fields/overview#field-level-hooks) |
| **`access`**         | Provide field-based access control to denote what users can see and do with this field's data. [More](/docs/fields/overview#field-level-access-control) |
| **`hidden`**         | Restrict this field's visibility from all APIs entirely. Will still be saved to the database, but will not appear in any API or the Admin panel. |
| **`defaultValue`**   | Provide data to be used for this field's default value. |
| **`localized`**      | Enable localization for this field. Requires [localization to be enabled](/docs/configuration/localization) in the Base config. |
| **`required`**       | Require this field to have a value. |
| **`admin`**          | Admin-specific configuration. See below for [more detail](#admin). |

*\* An asterisk denotes that an option is required.*

### Admin config

In addition to the default [field admin config](/docs/fields/overview#admin), the Code field type also allows for the customization of a `language` property.

Currently, the `language` property only supports JavaScript syntax but more support will be added as requested.

### Example

`collections/ExampleCollection.js`
```js
{
  slug: 'example-collection',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'trackingCode', // required
      type: 'code', // required
      label: 'Tracking Code',
      required: true,
      admin: {
        language: 'js'
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
