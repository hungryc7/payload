##### `mongoURL`

**Required**. This is a fully qualified MongoDB connection string that points to your MongoDB database. If you don't have MongoDB installed locally, you can [follow these steps for Mac OSX](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/) and [these steps](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) for Windows 10. If you want to use a local database and you know you have MongoDB installed locally, a typical connection string will look like this:

`mongodb://127.0.0.1/payload`

In contrast to running MongoDB locally, a popular option is to sign up for a free [MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), which is a fully hosted and cloud-based installation of MongoDB that you don't need to ever worry about.

##### `mongoOptions`

Customize MongoDB connection options. Payload will connect to your MongoDB database using default options which you can override and extend to include all the [options](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#options) available to mongoose.
