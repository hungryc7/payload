	Fields are the building blocks of Payload. Collections and Globals both use Fields to define the shape of the data that they store. Payload offers a wide-array of field-types - both simple and complex.
</Banner>

Fields are defined as an array on Collections and Globals via the `fields` key. They define the shape of the data that will be stored on Collections and Globals as well as automatically construct the corresponding Admin UI.

The required `type` property on a field determines what values it can accept, how it is presented in the API, and how the field will be rendered in the admin interface.

**Simple collection with two fields:**
```js
const Pages = {
	slug: 'pages',
	fields: [
		{
			name: 'my-field',
			type: 'text', // highlight-line
			label: 'My Field',
		},
		{
			name: 'other-field',
			type: 'checkbox', // highlight-line
			label: 'Other Field'
		},
	],
}
```
