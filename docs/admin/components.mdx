While designing the Payload Admin panel, we determined it should be as minimal and straightforward as possible to allow easy customization and control. There are many times where you may want to completely control how a whole view or a field works. You might even want to add in new views entirely. In order for Payload to support this level of customization without introducing versioning / future-proofing issues, Payload provides for a pattern to supply your own React components via your Payload config.

To swap in your own React component, first, consult the list of available component overrides below. Determine the scope that corresponds to what you are trying to accomplish, and then author your React component accordingly.

  Custom components will automatically be provided with all props that the default component normally
  accepts.

### Base Component Overrides

You can override a set of admin panel-wide components by providing a component to your base Payload config's `admin.components` property. The following options are available:

| Path                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Nav`**             | Contains the sidebar / mobile menu in its entirety.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **`BeforeNavLinks`**  | Array of components to inject into the built-in Nav, _before_ the links themselves.                                                                                                                         |
| **`AfterNavLinks`**   | Array of components to inject into the built-in Nav, _after_ the links.                                                                                                                                     |
| **`BeforeDashboard`** | Array of components to inject into the built-in Dashboard, _before_ the default dashboard contents.                                                                                                         |
| **`AfterDashboard`**  | Array of components to inject into the built-in Dashboard, _after_ the default dashboard contents. [Demo](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/master/test/admin/components/AfterDashboard/index.tsx) |
| **`BeforeLogin`**     | Array of components to inject into the built-in Login, _before_ the default login form.                                                                                                                     |
| **`AfterLogin`**      | Array of components to inject into the built-in Login, _after_ the default login form.                                                                                                                      |
| **`logout.Button`**   | A custom React component.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`graphics.Icon`**   | Used as a graphic within the `Nav` component. Often represents a condensed version of a full logo.                                                                                                          |
| **`graphics.Logo`**   | The full logo to be used in contexts like the `Login` view.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **`providers`**       | Define your own provider components that will wrap the Payload Admin UI. [More](#custom-providers)                                                                                                          |
| **`views`**           | Override or create new views within the Payload Admin UI. [More](#views)                                                                                                                             |

Here is a full example showing how to swap some of these components for your own.

`payload.config.js`

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'

import {
  MyCustomNav,
  MyCustomLogo,
  MyCustomIcon,
  MyCustomAccount,
  MyCustomDashboard,
  MyProvider,
} from './customComponents'

export default buildConfig({
  admin: {
    components: {
      Nav: MyCustomNav,
      graphics: {
        Icon: MyCustomIcon,
        Logo: MyCustomLogo,
      },
      views: {
        Account: MyCustomAccount,
        Dashboard: MyCustomDashboard,
      },
      providers: [MyProvider],
    },
  },
})
```

#### Views

You can easily swap entire views with your own by using the `admin.components.views` property. At the root level, Payload renders the following views that can be overridden:

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Account`**      | The Account view is used to show the currently logged in user's Account page.                                                |
| **`Dashboard`**    | The main landing page of the Admin panel.                                                                                    |

To swap out any of these views, simply pass in your custom component to the `admin.components.views` property of your Payload config. For example:

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        Account: MyCustomAccountView,
        Dashboard: MyCustomDashboardView,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

For more granular control, pass a configuration object instead. Payload exposes all of the properties of `<Route />` component in [React Router v5](https://v5.reactrouter.com):

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Component`** \* | Pass in the component that should be rendered when a user navigates to this route.                                           |
| **`path`** \*      | React Router `path`. [See the React Router docs](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Route/path-string-string) for more info. |
| **`exact`**        | React Router `exact` property. [More](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Route/exact-bool)                                   |
| **`strict`**       | React Router `strict` property. [More](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Route/strict-bool)                                 |
| **`sensitive`**    | React Router `sensitive` property. [More](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Route/sensitive-bool)                           |

_\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._

#### Adding new views

To add a _new_ view to the Admin Panel, simply add another key to the `views` object with at least a `path` and `Component` property. For example:

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        MyCustomView: {
          Component: MyCustomView,
          path: '/my-custom-view',
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

_For more examples regarding how to customize components, look at the following [examples](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/master/test/admin/components)._ For help on how to build your own custom view components, see the [Building a custom view component](#building-a-custom-view-component) section.

### Collections

You can override components on a collection-by-collection basis via their `admin` property.

| Path                       | Description                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`BeforeList`**           | Array of components to inject _before_ the built-in List view                                                          |
| **`BeforeListTable`**      | Array of components to inject _before_ the built-in List view's table                                                  |
| **`AfterList`**            | Array of components to inject _after_ the built-in List view                                                           |
| **`AfterListTable`**       | Array of components to inject _after_ the built-in List view's table                                                   |
| **`edit.SaveButton`**      | Replace the default `Save` button with a custom component. Drafts must be disabled                                     |
| **`edit.SaveDraftButton`** | Replace the default `Save Draft` button with a custom component. Drafts must be enabled and autosave must be disabled. |
| **`edit.PublishButton`**   | Replace the default `Publish` button with a custom component. Drafts must be enabled.                                  |
| **`edit.PreviewButton`**   | Replace the default `Preview` button with a custom component.                                                          |
| **`views`**                | Override or create new views within the Payload Admin UI. [More](#collection-views)                                    |

Here is a full example showing how to swap some of these components for your own:

`Collection.ts`

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'

import {
  CustomSaveButtonProps,
  CustomSaveDraftButtonProps,
  CustomPublishButtonProps,
  CustomPreviewButtonProps,
} from 'payload/types'

export const CustomSaveButton: CustomSaveButtonProps = ({ DefaultButton, label }) => {
  return <DefaultButton label={label} />
}

export const CustomSaveDraftButton: CustomSaveDraftButtonProps = ({
  DefaultButton,
  disabled,
  label,
  saveDraft,
}) => {
  return <DefaultButton label={label} disabled={disabled} saveDraft={saveDraft} />
}

export const CustomPublishButton: CustomPublishButtonProps = ({
  DefaultButton,
  disabled,
  label,
  publish,
}) => {
  return <DefaultButton label={label} disabled={disabled} publish={publish} />
}

export const CustomPreviewButton: CustomPreviewButtonProps = ({
  DefaultButton,
  disabled,
  label,
  preview,
}) => {
  return <DefaultButton label={label} disabled={disabled} preview={preview} />
}

export const MyCollection: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'my-collection',
  admin: {
    components: {
      edit: {
        SaveButton: CustomSaveButton,
        SaveDraftButton: CustomSaveDraftButton,
        PublishButton: CustomPublishButton,
        PreviewButton: CustomPreviewButton,
      },
    },
  }
}
```

#### Collection views

To swap out entire views on collections, you can use the `admin.components.views` property on the collection's config. Payload renders the following views by default that can be overridden:

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Edit`**         | The Edit view is used to edit a single document for a given Collection.                                                      |
| **`List`**         | The List view is used to show a list of documents for a given Collection.                                                    |

To swap out any of these views, simply pass in your custom component to the `admin.components.views` property of your Payload config. For example:

```ts
// Collection.ts
export const MyCollection: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'my-collection',
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        Edit: MyCustomEditView,
        List: MyCustomListView,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

To swap or add new _tabs_ to the `Edit` view, you can use the `admin.components.views.Edit` property on the collection's config. See the [Custom Tabs](#custom-tabs) section for more information. For help on how to build your own custom view components, see the [Building a custom view component](#building-a-custom-view-component) section.

### Globals

As with Collections, you can override components on a global-by-global basis via their `admin` property.

| Path                       | Description                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`edit.SaveButton`**      | Replace the default `Save` button with a custom component. Drafts must be disabled                                     |
| **`edit.SaveDraftButton`** | Replace the default `Save Draft` button with a custom component. Drafts must be enabled and autosave must be disabled. |
| **`edit.PublishButton`**   | Replace the default `Publish` button with a custom component. Drafts must be enabled.                                  |
| **`edit.PreviewButton`**   | Replace the default `Preview` button with a custom component.                                                          |
| **`views`**                | Override or create new views within the Payload Admin UI. [More](#global-views)                                        |

#### Global views

To swap out views for globals, you can use the `admin.components.views` property on the global's config. Payload renders the following views by default that you can override:

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Edit`**         | The Edit view is used to edit a single document for a given Global.                                                          |

To swap out any of these views, simply pass in your custom component to the `admin.components.views` property of your Payload config. For example:

```ts
export const MyGlobal: SanitizedGlobalConfig = {
  slug: 'my-global',
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        Edit: MyCustomEditView,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

To swap or add new _tabs_ to the `Edit` view, you can use the `admin.components.views.Edit` property on the collection's config. See the [Custom Tabs](#custom-tabs) section for more information. For help on how to build your own custom view components, see the [Building a custom view component](#building-a-custom-view-component) section.

### Custom Tabs

To can swap collection or global tabs, pass an _object_ to the `admin.components.views.Edit` property on any collection or global config. Payload renders the following views by default which can be overridden:

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Default`**      | The Default view is the primary view in which your document is edited.                                                       |
| **`Versions`**     | The Versions view is used to view the version history of a single document. [More details](../versions)                      |
| **`Version`**      | The Version view is used to view a single version of a single document for a given Collection. [More details](../versions).  |
| **`API`**          | The API view is used to display the REST API JSON response for a given document.                                             |
| **`LivePreview`**  | The LivePreview view is used to display the Live Preview interface. [More details](../live-preview)                          |

Here is an example:

```ts
// Collection.ts or Global.ts
export const MyCollection: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'my-collection',
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        Edit: {
          Default: MyCustomDefaultTab,
          Versions: MyCustomVersionsTab,
          Version: MyCustomVersionTab,
          API: MyCustomAPITab,
          LivePreview: MyCustomLivePreviewTab,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

To add a _new_ tab to the `Edit` view, simply add another key to the `views.Edit` object with at least a `path` and `Component` property. For example:

```ts
// `Collection.ts` or `Global.ts`
export const MyCollection: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'my-collection',
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        Edit: {
          MyCustomTab: {
            Component: MyCustomTab,
            path: '/my-custom-tab',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Building a custom view component

Your custom view components will be given all the props that a React Router `<Route />` typically would receive, as well as two props from Payload:

| Prop                    | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`user`**              | The currently logged in user. Will be `null` if no user is logged in.        |
| **`canAccessAdmin`** \* | If the currently logged in user is allowed to access the admin panel or not. |

<Banner type="warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  <br />
  It's up to you to secure your custom views. If your view requires a user to be logged in or to
  have certain access rights, you should handle that within your view component yourself.
</Banner>

#### Example

You can find examples of custom views in the [Payload source code `/test/admin/components/views` folder](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/master/test/admin/components/views). There, you'll find two custom views:

1. A custom view that uses the `DefaultTemplate`, which is the built-in Payload template that displays the sidebar and "eyebrow nav"
1. A custom view that uses the `MinimalTemplate` - which is just a centered template used for things like logging in or out

To see how to pass in your custom views to create custom views of your own, take a look at the `admin.components.views` property of the [Payload test admin config](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/master/test/admin/config.ts).

### Fields

All Payload fields support the ability to swap in your own React components. So, for example, instead of rendering a default Text input, you might need to render a color picker that provides the editor with a custom color picker interface to restrict the data entered to colors only.

  <strong>Tip:</strong>
  <br />
  Don't see a built-in field type that you need? Build it! Using a combination of custom validation
  and custom components, you can override the entirety of how a component functions within the admin
  panel and effectively create your own field type.

**Fields support the following custom components:**

| Component    | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Filter`** | Override the text input that is presented in the `List` view when a user is filtering documents by the customized field.    |
| **`Cell`**   | Used in the `List` view's table to represent a table-based preview of the data stored in the field. [More](#cell-component) |
| **`Field`**  | Swap out the field itself within all `Edit` views. [More](#field-component)                                                 |

## Cell Component

These are the props that will be passed to your custom Cell to use in your own components.

| Property         | Description                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`field`**      | An object that includes the field configuration.                  |
| **`colIndex`**   | A unique number for the column in the list.                       |
| **`collection`** | An object with the config of the collection that the field is in. |
| **`cellData`**   | The data for the field that the cell represents.                  |
| **`rowData`**    | An object with all the field values for the row.                  |

#### Example

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import './index.scss'
const baseClass = 'custom-cell'

const CustomCell: React.FC<Props> = (props) => {
  const { field, colIndex, collection, cellData, rowData } = props

  return <span className={baseClass}>{cellData}</span>
}
```

## Field Component

When writing your own custom components you can make use of a number of hooks to set data, get reactive changes to other fields, get the id of the document or interact with a context from a custom provider.

### Sending and receiving values from the form

When swapping out the `Field` component, you'll be responsible for sending and receiving the field's `value` from the form itself. To do so, import the `useField` hook as follows:

```tsx
import { useField } from 'payload/components/forms'

type Props = { path: string }

const CustomTextField: React.FC<Props> = ({ path }) => {
  // highlight-start
  const { value, setValue } = useField<Props>({ path })
  // highlight-end

  return <input onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} value={value.path} />
}
```

  components, including the <strong>useField</strong> hook, [click here](/docs/admin/hooks).

## Custom providers

As your admin customizations gets more complex you may want to share state between fields or other components. You can add custom providers to do add your own context to any Payload app for use in other custom components within the admin panel. Within your config add `admin.components.providers`, these can be used to share context or provide other custom functionality. Read the [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) docs to learn more.

  <strong>Reminder:</strong> Don't forget to pass the **children** prop through the provider
  component for the admin UI to show

### Styling Custom Components

Payload exports its SCSS variables and mixins for reuse in your own custom components. This is helpful in cases where you might want to style a custom input similarly to Payload's built-ini styling, so it blends more thoroughly into the existing admin UI.

To make use of Payload SCSS variables / mixins to use directly in your own components, you can import them as follows:

```
@import '~payload/scss';
```

### Getting the current language

When developing custom components you can support multiple languages to be consistent with Payload's i18n support. The best way to do this is to add your translation resources to the [i18n configuration](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/i18n) and import `useTranslation` from `react-i18next` in your components.

For example:

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'

const CustomComponent: React.FC = () => {
  // highlight-start
  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation('namespace1')
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <ul>
      <li>{t('key', { variable: 'value' })}</li>
      <li>{t('namespace2:key', { variable: 'value' })}</li>
      <li>{i18n.language}</li>
    </ul>
  )
}
```

### Getting the current locale

In any custom component you can get the selected locale with `useLocale` hook. `useLocale` returns the full locale object, consisting of a `label`, `rtl`(right-to-left) property, and then `code`. Here is a simple example:

```tsx
import { useLocale } from 'payload/components/utilities'

const Greeting: React.FC = () => {
  // highlight-start
  const locale = useLocale()
  // highlight-end

  const trans = {
    en: 'Hello',
    es: 'Hola',
  }

  return <span> {trans[locale.code]} </span>
}
```
