  The Blocks field type is <strong>incredibly powerful</strong> and can be used as a <em>layout builder</em> as well as to define any other flexible content model you can think of. It stores an array of objects, where each object must match the shape of one of your provided block configs.
</Banner>

**Example uses:**

- A layout builder tool that grants editors to design highly customizable page or post layouts. Blocks could include configs such as `Quote`, `CallToAction`, `Slider`, `Content`, `Gallery`, or others.
- A form builder tool where available block configs might be `Text`, `Select`, or `Checkbox`.
- Virtual event agenda "timeslots" where a timeslot could either be a `Break`, a `Presentation`, or a `BreakoutSession`.

### Config

| Option           | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| **`name`** *         | To be used as the property name when stored and retrieved from the database.  |
| **`label`**          | Used as a heading in the Admin panel and to name the generated GraphQL type. |
| **`blocks`** *       | Array of [block configs](/docs/fields/blocks#block-configs) to be made available to this field. |
| **`validate`**       | Provide a custom validation function that will be executed on both the Admin panel and the backend. [More](/docs/fields/overview#validation) |
| **`saveToJWT`**      | If this field is top-level and nested in a config supporting [Authentication](/docs/authentication/config), include its data in the user JWT. |
| **`hooks`**          | Provide field-based hooks to control logic for this field. [More](/docs/fields/overview#field-level-hooks) |
| **`access`**         | Provide field-based access control to denote what users can see and do with this field's data. [More](/docs/fields/overview#field-level-access-control) |
| **`hidden`**         | Restrict this field's visibility from all APIs entirely. Will still be saved to the database, but will not appear in any API or the Admin panel. |
| **`defaultValue`**   | Provide an array of row data to be used for this field's default value. |
| **`localized`**      | Enable localization for this field. Requires [localization to be enabled](/docs/configuration/localization) in the Base config. |
| **`required`**       | Require this field to have a value. |
| **`unique`**         | Enforce that each entry in the Collection has a unique value for this field. |
| **`labels`**         | Customize the row labels appearing in the Admin dashboard. |
| **`admin`**          | Admin-specific configuration. See below for [more detail](/docs/fields/array#admin). |

### Block configs

Blocks are defined as separate configs of their own.

<Banner type="success">
  <strong>Tip:</strong><br />
  Best practice is to define each block config in its own file, and then import them into your Blocks field as necessary. This way each block config can be easily shared between fields. For instance, using the "layout builder" example, you might want to feature a few of the same blocks in a Post collection as well as a Page collection. Abstracting into their own files trivializes their reusability.

`collections/ExampleCollection.js`
```js
{
  slug: 'example-collection',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'slider', // required
      type: 'array', // required
      label: 'Image Slider',
      minRows: 2,
      maxRows: 10,
      labels: {
        singular: 'Slide',
        plural: 'Slides',
      },
      fields: [ // required
        {
          name: 'image',
          label: 'Image',
          type: 'upload',
          relationTo: 'media',
          required: true,
        },
        {
          name: 'caption',
          label: 'Caption',
          type: 'text',
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
