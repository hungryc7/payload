- Show how to install official bundler
- Give banner "warning" that this is in beta
- Talk about how you should see performance improvements in both build times and HMR
- Initial load might not be substantially faster, because Vite pre-bundles dependencies
- Talk about the new `admin.vite` property
- Talk about how for compatibility, the Vite config still automatically adds aliases that come in from the `admin.webpack` property

- Aliases work differently in Vite vs. Webpack (you can't pass Vite an absolute path to your alias source, it needs to match perfectly)
