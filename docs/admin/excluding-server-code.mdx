### Aliasing server-only modules

Because the Admin Panel browser bundle includes your Payload Config file, files using server-only modules need to be excluded.
It's common for your config to rely on server only modules to perform logic in access control functions, hooks, and other contexts.

Any file that imports a server-only module such as `fs`, `stripe`, `authorizenet`, `nodemailer`, etc. **cannot** be included in the browser bundle.

#### Let's Look at an example

Say we have a collection called `Subscriptions` that has a `beforeChange` hook that creates a Stripe subscription whenever a Subscription document is created in Payload.

##### Your collection config

```ts
// collections/Subscriptions/index.ts

import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'
import createStripeSubscription from './hooks/createStripeSubscription'

export const Subscription: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'subscriptions',
  hooks: {
    beforeChange: [createStripeSubscription],
  },
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'stripeSubscriptionID',
      type: 'text',
      required: true,
    },
  ],
}
```

##### Your collection hook

```ts
// collections/Subscriptions/hooks/createStripeSubscription.ts

// highlight-start
import Stripe from 'stripe' // <-- server-only module
// highlight-end

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)

export const createStripeSubscription = async ({ data, operation }) => {
  if (operation === 'create') {
    const dataWithStripeID = { ...data }

    // use Stripe to create a Stripe subscription
    const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.create({
      // Configure the subscription accordingly
    })

    // Automatically add the Stripe subscription ID
    // to the data that will be saved to this Subscription doc
    dataWithStripeID.stripeSubscriptionID = subscription.id

    return dataWithStripeID
  }

  return data
}
```

<Banner type="error">
  <strong>Warning:</strong>
  <br />
  The above code is NOT production-ready and should not be referenced to create Stripe
  subscriptions. Although creating a beforeChange hook is a completely valid spot to do things like
  create subscriptions, the code above is incomplete and insecure, meant for explanation purposes
  only.

**As-is, this collection will prevent your Admin panel from bundling or loading correctly, because Stripe relies on some Node-only packages.**

#### How to fix this

You need to make sure that you use `alias`es to tell your bundler to import "safe" files vs. attempting to import any server-side code that you need to get rid of. Depending on your bundler (Webpack, Vite, etc.) the steps involved may be slightly different. 

The basic idea is to create a file that exports an empty object, and then alias import paths of any files that import server-only modules to that empty object file.

This way when your bundler goes to import a file that contains server-only modules, it will instead import the empty object file, which will not break the browser bundle.

### Aliasing server-only modules

To remove files that contain server-only modules from your bundle, you can use an `alias`.

First create new file that exports an empty object:
```js
// mocks/emptyObject.js

export default {}
```

Then, in your Payload config, you can alias the file containing the server-only module to the mock module. For example, here's how you'd do this in Webpack:

```ts
// payload.config.ts

import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { webpackBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-webpack'

const mockModulePath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'mocks/emptyObject.js')
const pathToFileWithServerOnlyModule = path.resolve(__dirname, 'hooks/syncStripeCustomer.ts')

export default buildConfig({
  admin: {
    bundler: webpackBundler(),
    webpack: (config) => {
      return {
        ...config,
        resolve: {
          ...config.resolve,
          // highlight-start
          alias: {
            ...config.resolve.alias,
            [pathToFileWithServerOnlyModule]: mockModulePath,
          },
          // highlight-end
        },
      }
    },
  },
})
```
