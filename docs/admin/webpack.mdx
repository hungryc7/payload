Payload has a Webpack (v5) bundler that you can build the Admin panel with. We recommended using it because it is stable. If you are feeling a bit more adventurous you can give the Vite bundler shot.

Out of the box the Webpack bundler supports common functionalities such as SCSS and Typescript, but there are many cases where you may need to add support for additional functionalities.

To use webpack as your bundler, you must install it:

```bash
yarn add @payloadcms/bundler-webpack
```

After installing, set the `bundler: webpackBundler()` on your Payload config. If you would like to extend the Webpack config, you can do so by passing a function to the webpack property.

```ts
// payload.config.ts

import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { webpackBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-webpack'

export default buildConfig({
  admin: {
    // highlight-start
    bundler: webpackBundler()
    webpack: (config) => {
      // full control of the Webpack config

      return config
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
  // rest of your payload config
})
```

### Aliasing server-only modules

To remove files that contain server-only modules from your bundle, you can use the `alias` Webpack feature.

First create a mock module that exports an empty object:
```js
// mocks/emptyObject.js

export default {}
```

Then, in your Payload config, you can alias the file containing the server-only module to the mock module:
```ts
// payload.config.ts

import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { webpackBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-webpack'

const mockModulePath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'mocks/emptyObject.js')
const pathToFileWithServerOnlyModule = path.resolve(__dirname, 'hooks/syncStripeCustomer.ts')

export default buildConfig({
  admin: {
    bundler: webpackBundler(),
    webpack: (config) => {
      return {
        ...config,
        resolve: {
          ...config.resolve,
          // highlight-start
          alias: {
            ...config.resolve.alias,
            [pathToFileWithServerOnlyModule]: mockModulePath,
          },
          // highlight-end
        },
      }
    },
  },
  // rest of your payload config
})
```

  <strong>Tip:</strong>
  <br />
  If changes to your Webpack aliases are not surfacing, they might be
  [cached](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/cache/) in `node_modules/.cache/webpack`. Try
  deleting that folder and restarting your server.
