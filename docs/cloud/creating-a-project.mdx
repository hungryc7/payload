## Starting from a Template

Payload Cloud templates provide a one-click, simple solution to quickly deploy a new application. Templates come preconfigured, so there is no additional set up needed to run your application on Payload Cloud.

After creating an account, select your desired template from the Projects page. At this point, you will need to connect to Authorize the Payload Cloud application with your GitHub account. Click Continue with GitHub and follow the prompts to authorize the app.

Next, select your `GitHub Scope`. If you belong to multiple organizations they will show up here. If do not see the organization you are looking for, you may need to adjust your GitHub app permissions.

After selecting your scope, choose a unique `repository name` for and select whether or not you want your repository to be public or private on GitHub.

Once you are ready, click **Create Project**. This will clone a repository of the template you selected to your GitHub account, and take you to the configuration page to set up your project for deployment.

## Importing from an Existing Codebase
