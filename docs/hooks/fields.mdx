Field-level hooks offer incredible potential for encapsulating your logic. They help to isolate concerns and package up functionalities to be easily reusable across your projects.

**Example use cases include:**

- Automatically add an `owner` relationship to a Document based on the `req.user.id`
- Encrypt / decrypt a sensitive field using `beforeValidate` and `afterRead` hooks
- Auto-generate field data using a `beforeValidate` hook
- Format incoming data such as kebab-casing a document `slug` with `beforeValidate`
- Restrict updating a document to only once every X hours using the `beforeChange` hook

**All field types provide the following hooks:**

- `beforeValidate`
- `beforeChange`
- `afterChange`
- `afterRead`

## Config

Example field configuration:

```js
{
  name: 'name',
  label: 'Name',
  type: 'text',
  // highlight-start
  hooks: {
    beforeValidate: [(args) => {...}],
    beforeChange: [(args) => {...}],
    afterChange: [(args) => {...}],
    afterRead: [(args) => {...}],
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```

## Arguments and return values

All field-level hooks are formatted to accept the same arguments, although some arguments may be `undefined` based on which field hook you are utilizing.

  It's a good idea to conditionally scope your logic based on which operation is
  executing.

#### Arguments

Field Hooks receive one `args` argument that contains the following properties:

| Option            | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`value`**       | The value of the field, before any updating. Will return `undefined` within `create` operations. |
| **`data`**        | The data passed to update the field with in `create` and `update` operations.                    |
| **`originalDoc`** | The full original document in `update` or `read` operations.                                     |
| **`operation`**   | A string relating to which operation the field type is currently executing within.               |
| **`req`**         | The Express `request` object. It is mocked for Local API operations.                             |

#### Return value

Field hooks **must** return the intended value for the field to be used in the operation. You can modify the return value of the field before the operation continues, or simply send the `value` that you receive through the hook's argument. If you return `undefined` within a `beforeChange` or `beforeValidate` hook, the property will be unset from its document.

  <strong>Important</strong>
  <br />
  Due to GraphQL's typed nature, you should never change the type of data that
  you return from a field, otherwise GraphQL will produce errors. If you need to
  change the shape or type of data, reconsider Field Hooks and instead evaluate
  if Collection / Global hooks might suit you better.
