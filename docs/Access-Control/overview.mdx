Access can be configured at a Collection-level or field-level within your Collection configuration.

Access control functions return a boolean result in most cases. Certain functions also support returning a [where constraint object](/docs/queries/overview)

**Default access control requires a logged in user to do anything.**

Local API skips access control by default, but can be enabled if you pass a user to the operation.
