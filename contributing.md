# Contributing to Payload CMS

Below you'll find a set of guidelines for how to contribute to Payload CMS.

## Payload is proprietary software

Even though you can read Payload's source code, it's technically not "open source". Payload requires an active license to be used in all production purposes. That said, we do not expect PRs from the public, but we still welcome pull requests of any kind.

## Opening issues

Before you submit an issue, please check all existing [open and closed issues](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues) to see if your issue has previously been resolved or is already known. If there is already an issue logged, feel free to upvote it by adding a :thumbsup: [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). If you would like to submit a new issue, please fill out our Issue Template to the best of your ability so we can accurately understand your report.

## Security issues & vulnerabilities

If you come across an issue related to security, or a potential attack vector within Payload or one of its dependencies, please DO NOT create a publicly viewable issue. Instead, please contact us directly at [`dev@payloadcms.com`](mailto:dev@payloadcms.com). We will do everything we can to respond to the issue as soon as possible.

If you find a vulnerability within the core Payload repository, and we determine that it is remediable and of significant nature, we will be happy to pay you a reward for your findings and diligence. [`Contact us`](mailto:dev@payloadcms.com) to find out more.

## Documentation edits

Payload documentation can be found directly within its codebase and you can feel free to make changes / improvements to any of it through opening a PR. We utilize these files directly in our website and will periodically deploy documentation updates as necessary.

## Building additional features

If you're an incredibly awesome person and want to help us make Payload even better through new features or additions, we would be thrilled to work with you. If your proposed feature is accepted by our team and is significant enough, pending our discretion, we'd be happy to hook you up with a pro-bono license.

To help us work on new features, you can reach out to our Development team at [`dev@payloadcms.com`](mailto:dev@payloadcms.com). Be as complete and descriptive as possible regarding your vision and we'll go from there!

## Pull Requests

For all Pull Requests, you should be extremely descriptive about both your problem and proposed solution. If there are any affected open or closed issues, please leave the issue number in your PR message.

By opening a Pull Request against Payload's codebase, you automatically give the entirety of the contribution within your PR to Payload CMS, LLC and retain no personal ownership whatsoever afterward. For more information, please read the full [Payload license](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/master/license.md).
