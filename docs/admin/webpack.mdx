Payload has a Webpack (v5) bundler that you can build the Admin panel with. We recommended using it because it is stable. If you are feeling a bit more adventurous you can give the [Vite](/docs/admin/vite) bundler shot.

Out of the box the Webpack bundler supports common functionalities such as SCSS and Typescript, but there are many cases where you may need to add support for additional functionalities.

#### Install the bundler

```bash
yarn add @payloadcms/bundler-webpack
```

#### Import the bundler

```ts
// payload.config.ts

import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { webpackBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-webpack'

export default buildConfig({
  // highlight-start
  admin: {
    bundler: webpackBundler()
  },
  // highlight-end
})
```

### Extending Webpack

If you need to extend the Webpack config, you can do so by passing a function to the `admin.webpack` property on your Payload config.
The function will receive the Webpack config as an argument and should return the modified config.

```ts
// payload.config.ts

import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { webpackBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-webpack'

export default buildConfig({
  admin: {
    bundler: webpackBundler()
    // highlight-start
    webpack: (config) => {
      // full control of the Webpack config

      return config
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
})
```

### Aliasing server-only modules

To remove files that contain server-only modules from your bundle, you can use Webpack's `alias` feature.

First create new file that exports an empty object:
```js
// mocks/emptyObject.js

export default {}
```

Then, in your Payload config, you can alias the file containing the server-only module to the mock module:
```ts
// payload.config.ts

import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { webpackBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-webpack'

const mockModulePath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'mocks/emptyObject.js')
const pathToFileWithServerOnlyModule = path.resolve(__dirname, 'hooks/syncStripeCustomer.ts')

export default buildConfig({
  admin: {
    bundler: webpackBundler(),
    webpack: (config) => {
      return {
        ...config,
        resolve: {
          ...config.resolve,
          // highlight-start
          alias: {
            ...config.resolve.alias,
            [pathToFileWithServerOnlyModule]: mockModulePath,
          },
          // highlight-end
        },
      }
    },
  },
})
```

  <strong>Tip:</strong>
  <br />
  If changes to your Webpack aliases are not surfacing, they might be
  [cached](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/cache/) in `node_modules/.cache/webpack`. Try
  deleting that folder and restarting your server.
