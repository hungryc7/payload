### BREAKING CHANGES

We have removed our reliance on SCSS variables like color and font, replacing them instead with CSS variables wherever possible.

Due to this change, the `admin.scss` functionality has become obsolete, and overriding SCSS variables is not longer needed or supported. If you want to customize CSS, you can still do so, but via the `admin.css` property instead.

# [0.15.0](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/compare/v0.14.0...v0.15.0) (2022-03-16)

### BREAKING CHANGES

The GraphQL error response data object has moved from the top level to the extensions object.

Here is a previous example:

```js
{
 "message": "The following fields are invalid: location,",
 "data": [
  {
   "message": "This field requires two numbers",
   "field": "location"
  },
 ]
},
```

The new shape of GraphQL errors is as follows:

```js
"extensions": {
 "name": "ValidationError",
 "data": [
  {
   "message": "This field requires two numbers",
   "field": "location"
  },
 ]
}
```

# [0.9.0](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/compare/v0.8.2...v0.9.0) (2021-08-02)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Due to greater plugin possibilities and performance enhancements, plugins themselves no longer accept a completely sanitized config. Instead, they accept a _validated_ config as-provided, but sanitization is now only performed after all plugins have been initialized. By config santitization, we refer to merging in default values and ensuring that the config has its full, required shape. What this now means for plugins is that within plugin code, deeply nested properties like `config.graphQL.mutations` will need to be accessed safely (optional chaining is great for this), because a user's config may not have defined `config.graphQL`. So, the only real breaking change here is are that plugins now need to safely access properties from an incoming config.

### Features

- removes sanitization of configs before plugins are instantiated ([8af3947](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/8af39472e19a26453647d1c1ab0bbce15db2c642))

## [0.8.2](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/compare/v0.8.1...v0.8.2) (2021-08-02)

### Features

- export error types ([12cba62](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/12cba62930b8d35b22e3a7a99cf06df29bd4964a))

## [0.8.1](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1) (2021-07-29)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- If you have any plugins that are written in TypeScript, we have changed plugin types to make them more flexible. Whereas before you needed to take in a fully sanitized config, and return a fully sanitized config, we now have simplified that requirement so that you can write configs in your own plugins just as an end user of Payload can write their own configs.

Now, configs will be sanitized **_before_** plugins are executed **_as well as_** after plugins are executed.

So, where your plugin may have been typed like this before:

```ts
import { SanitizedConfig } from "payload/config";

const plugin = (config: SanitizedConfig): SanitizedConfig => {
  return {
    ...config,
  };
};
```

It can now be written like this:

```ts
import { Config } from "payload/config";

const plugin = (config: Config): Config => {
  return {
    ...config,
  };
};
```

### Features

- improves plugin writability ([a002b71](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/a002b7105f5c312e846c80032a350046db10236c))

# [0.8.0](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/compare/v0.7.10...v0.8.0) (2021-07-28)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- There have been a few very minor, yet breaking TypeScript changes in this release. If you are accessing Payload config types from directly within the `dist` folder, like any of the following:

- `import { PayloadCollectionConfig, CollectionConfig } from 'payload/dist/collections/config/types';`
- `import { PayloadGlobalConfig, GlobalConfig } from 'payload/dist/globals/config/types';`
- `import { Config, PayloadConfig } from 'payload/config';`

You may need to modify your code to work with this release. The TL;DR of the change is that we have improved our naming conventions of internally used types, which will become more important over time. Now, we have landed on a naming convention as follows:

- Incoming configs, typed correctly for optional / required config properties, are named `Config`, `CollectionConfig`, and `GlobalConfig`.
- Fully defaulted, sanitized, and validated configs are now named `SanitizedConfig`, `SanitizedCollectionConfig`, and `SanitizedGlobalConfig`.

They can be imported safely outside of the `dist` folder now as well. For more information on how to properly import which types you need, see the following Docs pages which have now been updated with examples on how to properly access the new types:

- [Base Payload config docs](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/overview)
- [Collection config docs](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections)
- [Global config docs](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/globals)

# [0.6.0](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/compare/v0.5.10...v0.6.0) (2021-04-19)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- By default, all Collection and Global access control functions are now set to require a user to be logged in to interact through GraphQL or REST APIs. This default access control is set to ensure that your API data is secure out of the box. From there, you can opt to publicly expose API actions as you need.

#### Migration Instructions to `0.6.x`

If you have any Collections or Globals that should be publicly available without being logged in, you need to define an access control function for each operation that needs to be publicly available.

For example, if you have a `pages` collection with no existing access control, and it should be publicly readable, you should change its config from this:

```js
const Page = {
  slug: "pages",
  access: {
    // No `read` access control was set
  },
};
```

To:

```js
const Page = {
  slug: "pages",
  access: {
    // Now we explicitly allow public read access
    // to this collection's documents
    read: () => true,
  },
};
```

If none of your collections or globals should be publicly exposed, you don't need to do anything to upgrade.
