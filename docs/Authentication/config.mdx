Talk about how to configure authentication here.

Need to cover:

1. What collection to use for Admin panel and how there can only be one
1. Can have multiple auth collections
1. Token expiration
1. Email verification
1. Security (max login, lock time)
1. API keys
1. Depth to populate (performance impact)
1. Cookie settings (HTTP only discussion)
