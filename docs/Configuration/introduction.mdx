title: The Payload Config
label: Introduction
order: 10
---

The Payload config is central to everything that Payload does. It scaffolds the data that Payload stores as well as maintains custom React components, hook logic, custom validations, and much more. The config itself and all of its dependencies are run through Babel, so you can take full advantage newer JavaScript features and even directly import React components containing JSX.

<strong>It's also strongly typed with TypeScript, which means that even if you aren't using TypeScript to build your project, your IDE (such as VSCode) may still provide helpful information like typeahead suggestions.</strong>
