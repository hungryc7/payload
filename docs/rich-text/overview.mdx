TODO:

- Talk about how Payload supports two rich text editors, and they work on an "adapter" pattern, which means you need to install the one you want to use separately and pass it to config
- Talk about how Slate is still supported for legacy projects, but we are moving to Lexical from here on out which offers more features
- For new projects as of 2.0, use Lexical
- For existing projects, use Slate
- Probably move some of the more complex docs from Fields -> Rich Text over to this set of docs
- Show how you can install an editor at the top level, or override on a field-by-field basis (not recommended, no reason to have 2 editors installed. Lots of JS loaded)
