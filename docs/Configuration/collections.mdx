Payload Collections are defined through configs of their own, and you can define as many as your application needs. Each Collection will scaffold a MongoDB collection automatically based on fields that you define.

It's often best practice to write your Collections in separate files and then import them into the main Payload config.

## Collection Config Options

| Option           | Description  |
| ---------------- | -------------|
| `slug`           | Unique, URL-friendly string that will act as a global identifier for this collection. |
| `labels`         | Singular and plural labels for use in identifying this collection throughout Payload. |
| `fields`         | Array of field types that will determine the structure and functionality of the data stored within this collection. [Click here](/docs/fields/overview) for a full list of field types as well as how to configure them. |
| `admin`          | Admin-specific configuration. See below for [more detail](/docs/collections#admin). |
| `preview`        | Function to generate preview URLS within the Admin panel that can point to your app. [More](/docs/collections#preview). |
| `hooks`          | Entry points to "tie in" to collection actions at specific points. [More](/docs/hooks/config#collection-hooks) |
| `access`         | Provide access control functions to define exactly who should be able to do what with documents in this collection. [More](/docs/access-control/config/#collections) |
| `auth`           | Specify options if you would like this collection to feature authentication. For more, consult the [Authentication](/docs/authentication/config) documentation. |
| `upload`         | Specify options if you would like this collection to support file uploads. For more, consult the [Uploads](/docs/uploads/config) documentation. |

#### Simple example

```js
const Order = {
	slug: 'orders',
	labels: {
		singular: 'Order',
		plural: 'Orders',
	},
	fields: [
		{
			name: 'total',
			type: 'number',
			required: true,
		},
		{
			name: 'placedBy',
			type: 'relationship',
			relationTo: 'customers',
			required: true,
		}
	]
}
```

You can find an assortment of [example collection configs](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/master/demo/collections) in the Payload source code on GitHub.

### Admin options

You can customize the way that the Admin panel behaves on a collection-by-collection basis by defining the `admin` property on a collection's config.

#### Admin Collection Options

| Option                       | Description  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------|
| `useAsTitle`                 | Specify a top-level field to use for a document title throughout the Admin panel. If no field is defined, the ID of the document is used as the title. |
| `defaultColumns`             | Array of field names that correspond to which columns to show by default in this collection's List view. |
| `disableDuplicate `          | Disables the "Duplicate" button while editing documents within this collection. |
| `enableRichTextRelationship` | The [Rich Text](/docs/fields/rich-text) field features a `Relationship` element which allows for users to automatically reference related documents within their rich text. Set this field to `true` to enable the collection to be selected within it. |
| `components`                 | Swap in your own React components to be used within this collection. [More](/docs/admin/components#collections) |
